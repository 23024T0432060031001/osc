Feature: Manage user accounts


@destructive
Scenario: Run `osc ls` under the newly created user that has a password with unicode characters
   Given I start a new container without proxy auth
     And I set working directory to "{context.osc.temp}"
     And I execute osc with args "api -X POST '/person?cmd=register' --file '{context.fixtures}/user/unicode.xml'"
     And I configure osc user "unicode" with password "Password with unicode characters ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€"
    When I execute osc with args "ls test:factory"
    Then the exit code is 0
