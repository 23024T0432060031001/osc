osc -- opensuse-commander with svn like handling


Please send patches to poeml@suse.de, or work directly on
https://forgesvn1.novell.com/svn/opensuse/trunk/buildservice/src/clientlib/python/osc/


INSTALLATION:

RPM packages are here (yum repository):
http://software.opensuse.org/download/repositories/openSUSE:Tools/

To install from svn, do
	python setup.py build
	python setup.py install
	# create a symlink 'osc' in your path pointing to osc.py.
	ln -s osc-wrapper.py /usr/bin/osc

Alternatively, you can directly use osc-wrapper.py from the source dir


The program needs the following python packages installed (that's their names
on SUSE anyway): 
	pyxml 
	python-elementtree




CONFIGURATION:

osc uses authentication data if it finds it in .netrc, otherwise it will ask
for username/password once, and store it in ~/.oscrc.
