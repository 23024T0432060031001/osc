osc -- opensuse-commander with svn like handling


Please send patches to poeml@suse.de, or work directly on
https://forgesvn1.novell.com/svn/opensuse/trunk/buildservice/src/clientlib/python/osc/


INSTALLATION:

RPM packages are here (yum repository):
http://software.opensuse.org/download/openSUSE:/Tools/

To install from svn, do
	python setup.py build
	python setup.py install
	# create a symlink 'osc' in your path pointing to osc.py.
	ln -s osc-wrapper.py /usr/bin/osc

Alternatively, you can directly use osc-wrapper.py from the source dir
(which is easier if you develop on osc).


The program needs the cElementTree python module installed. On SUSE, the
respective package is called python-elementtree.



CONFIGURATION:

When you use it for the first time, it will ask you for your username and
password, and store it in ~/.oscrc.

If authentication data is found in .netrc, it will also be used.



USAGE EXAMPLES:
(online at http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/CLI )

To list existing content on the server
 osc ls 				# list projects
 osc ls Apache 			# list packages in a project 
 osc ls Apache subversion 	# list files of package of a project

Check out content
 osc co Apache 			# entire project
 osc co Apache subversion	# a package
 osc co Apache subversion foo	# single file

Update a working copy
 osc up
 osc up [pac_dir]		# update a single package by its path
 osc up * 			# from within a project dir, update all packages
 osc up  			# from within a project dir, update all packages
				   AND check out all newly added packages

If an update can't be merged automatically, a file is in 'C' (conflict)
state, and conflicts are marked with special <<<<<<< and >>>>>>> lines. 
After manually resolving the problem, use
 osc resolved foo

Upload change content
 osc ci				# current dir
 osc ci <dir>
 osc ci file1 file2 ...

Show the status (which files have been changed locally)
 osc st
 osc st <directory>
 osc st file1 file2 ...

Mark files to be added or removed on the next 'checkin'
 osc add file1 file2 ...
 osc rm file1 file2 ...

Adds all new files in local copy and removes all disappeared files.
 osc addremove
