CRITICAL:
  - there is no way to list my old requests, regardless of their state,
    the online help is misleading about comma seperated lists.
    osc request list -s revoked,revoked openSUSE:Tools 	-> lists 37
    osc request list -s accecpted openSUSE:Tools 	-> lists 113
    osc request list -s accecpted,revoked openSUSE:Tools 	-> lists 0

 - hitting the wrong build service is a legal risk. 
   osc has no guard against forgetting -A. Add automatic pickup from current path.

 - webpage can create a _link in a fully populated package.
   Need to prevent his somehow.

 - cat -E <srcmd5> -r 3 <file>  should expand through the third revision of the link to a
   named md5sum revision of the file. Or is this nonsense???
   
 - canonical option parser.
   -A, -e, -u, -E <n>, should be univeral to all subconmmands that work on prj/pkg objects.
   With all subcommands that work on prj/pkg, the following should all be synonyms:
   -A apiurl prj pkg
   -A apiurl --project prj --package=pkg
   -A apiurl prj/pkg
   -A apiurl prj:pkg
   apiurl/source/prj/pkg
   The current working directory or its descendants should provide defaults 
   for apiurl, prj and/or pkg.

 - checkout working directories should be real directories. No more colons.
   A prj / package nameing collision shall be resolved by renaming the project to 
   have a .prj suffix


MAJOR:

NORMAL:

  - improvements submit requests:
    - create: enforce message
    - create: check if there is already a request open for that target package
      (if so, offer to obsolete it?)
    - for done requests, show accept/reject messages also

  - split functionality that needs prj/pac as commandline arguments into a seperate tool (oscremote? osc -r?)
    (update: we have some commands meanwhile which exist in an alternate form,
    prefixed with r, which works remotely. E.g. rbuildlog, rprjresults, rresults)
  - status: implement -u option as in svn          [3]
  - implement (svn-like) switch command
  - implement 'mv' command
  - _real_ SSL support, with certificate verification
  - copypac: put the current release number into the spec file before sending it
    - for this, it is required to scan all current binaries, pick the highest release number 
      and put it into the spec file... otherwise clients won't regard the copied package as newer
  - commit: check if errors during PUT are handled sensibly, so the change is
    not committed to localmeta	
  - add switch to commit to change repository options, like to e.g. disable publishing?
  - implement optional logging to .osc/log, which could be useful for debugging bugs like
    the one where api.opensuse.org sends empty replies (a hard-to-catch one)


MINOR: 

  - osc checkout should display file download progress (bnc#442115)
  - new command: osc listbinaries [<project>] [<package>]
    listing the built package, either as URLs or just the filenames?        	[1]
    there is ls -b:
     % osc ls -b home:poeml scapy -r openSUSE_Factory -a x86_64
    scapy-1.0.4-12.13.noarch.rpm
    scapy-1.0.4-12.13.src.rpm
    but it works packagewise. A project wide binary listing would also be cool
  - new command: osc getbinaries [<project>] [<package>] [<rpm>]+           	[1]
    -> see incarnations of obs_mirror_project, in particular James Oakleys 
       obs_mirror_project.py
    this can peruse the new get_binarylist() and get_binary_file() functions
  - adjust zsh completion to work with cmdln.py implementation
  - add support for adding tags to packages?
  - evaluate password storage alternatives
    - use http://code.google.com/p/iniparse/ instead of ConfigParser, with
      write capability, for the change




15:16 < DuDE> mt: Projekte anlegen geht nur, wenn es ein Subprojekt ist von einem Projekt wo Du Schreibrechte hast
15:16 < mt> DuDE: wof√ºr?
15:16 < DuDE> mt: dass jeder einfach so top-level-Projekte anlegen kann, war einmal. Chaos-Reduzierung
15:17 < DuDE> mt: ueblich ist heutzutage ein Request auf opensuse-buildservice@
15:18 < DuDE> mt: kannst Du das gleiche mal eben mit osc -H probieren? Mich wuerde mal interessieren, ob da eine sinnvollere Meldung im Body mitkommt
15:19 < mt> DuDE: reply: 'HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\r\n'
15:20 < DuDE> mt: das ist gut, dann sollte osc kein "try again" anbieten, sondern die Meldung rueberbringen


JW:
FIXME: osc co overwrites local changes without warning.
FIXME: when branching, the user should be added to bugowner, for the branch project.
FIXME: 'osc req' shall default to 'osc req list -M -B -s all', 
       where -B shows requests related to packages where I am the bugowner.
FIXME: 'osc log openSUSE:Factory PKG' should also point to the bsdevelproject
