split functionality that needs prj/pac as commandline arguments into a seperate tool (oscremote)

implement a package search / indexing


> BTW: Can I upload a src.rpm instead of a tarball also?
no, because not all tools will be able to handle a src.rpm. And you will not
be able to build non rpm packages from it.
But someone could patch the commandline tool osc to import a src.rpm by
extracting it (hint hint ;)
