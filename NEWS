0.4:
- allow 'up' inside a project directory (will automatically pull in all new
  packages)
- checkout: preserve mtimes


0.3:
- use the new file metadata, which provides checksum, size and mtime
- faster 'status', 'update', 'diff'
- improve argument handling, now e.g. 'osc up *' is possible
- on first usage, ask for username and password and store them in .oscrc
  (.netrc can still be used)
