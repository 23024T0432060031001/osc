since 0.9:
- fix important bug, which could lead to overwriting local modifications when
  upstream changes are merged in
- if a merge fails, the store copy must be updated neverthelesss
- fix testsuite and add testcase for successful merging
- sort output of 'status' (unknown files first, filenames alphabetically)
- core: added class "metadata" (merge from Susannes /branches/froh/reponator/)
- added command alias 'stat' for 'status', like in svn
- improved documentation/examples (Lars + Susanne)
- print usage info if 'co' is called without arguments

0.9:
- "iChain-ready" (works with API server now using iChain authentication)
- add runtime check for build.rpm version, so the rpm package dependency is
  no longer required
- add 'edituser' command for editing the metadata of a user account. It tries
  to create a user if it doesn't exist yet. A new command 'usermeta' replaces
  'id' respectively 'userid'.
- rewrite configuration handling. Now the API server can be set in .oscrc
- ignore '.gitignore', '.pc', '*~' (now using filename matching [#208969]
- fix 'status' to work with project directories as arguments
- fix 'status <filename>'
- 'rebuildpac' now accepts additional repo and arch argument. Note:
  the syntax has changed.
- add 'prjresults' command to display aggregated build status over
  an entire project
- add 'deleteprj' command (the API server doesn't seem to support
  it yet, though)
- change 'buildhistory' to display human-readable text
- add 'copypac' subcommand, to copy a complete package to a new package, possibly cross-project
- don't die if user tries to 'add' a file which is already versioned
- don't die if 'addremove' encounters directories
- urlopen(): for server return code 500, print out the reply body

0.8:
- build: use configuration from *local* specfile (e.g. BuildRequires)
- build: let envvars OSC_SU_WRAPPER and OSC_BUILD_ROOT override config 
- build: allow 'dynamical' build-root setting by using %(repo)s and %(arch)s
- add 'createpac/editpac' and 'createprj/editprj' subcommands which
  are similar to 'editmeta' but should be more logical to find
- added 'deletepac' subcommand
- added 'buildhistory' subcommand (formerly 'history'). This only
  gives out raw xml at this time
- added 'linkpac' subcommand
- added ".git" to the excluded files
- adapt to API changes
- fixed issue with uploading files when an intercepting web proxy was
  in between osc and the api server
- fixed creation of new packages/projects

0.7:
- initial support for local builds (subcommand 'build')
- better error handling
- new subcommands buildconfig, buildinfo, repos
- remove requirement on pyxml package
- editmeta: add examples for package/project templates
- add support for streaming the build log (thanks to Christoph Thiel)
- add 'rebuildpac' subcommand
- add 'repourls' subcommand
- don't diff binary files
- don't try to merge binary files
- add a preliminary 'updatepacmetafromspec' subcommand, which takes package
  metadata from a specfile
- fix profiling wrapper
- set User-agent
- bugfixes: 
  - fix handling of filenames with '+' signs
  - make 'resolved' more robust
  - fix merge on 'update' if called from another directory
  - display reason for build status is 'broken'
  - handle HTTP error codes != 404 when reading metadata in edit_meta()
  - handle 'project not found' error in show_project_meta()


0.6:
- diff bugfix: sometimes displayed diff against obsolete files
- update bugfixes: fix update of working copy when adding a file from upstream
  which is missing locally; fix update in directory with unmodified files:
  don't try to merge if upstream file wasn't changed at all
- add: make it faster


0.5:
- help :-)
- add 'editmeta' subcommand: Edit project/package meta information, creating
  new project or package if it doesn't exist. The user interface is $EDITOR
- fix status letter for files merged on update (in analogy to svn , it is
  either G or U)
- if an old _files listing without any metadata is found, don't bother the user
  with it
- make all subcommands properly importable functions
- bug in 'resolved' command fixed, which wouldn't clear the conflict state of a file


0.4:
- allow 'up' inside a project directory (will automatically pull in all new
  packages). (For past checkouts, you may need to put the project name into 
  $prjdir/.osc/_project yourself).
- checkout: preserve mtimes
- add diff3 merge support. Locally modified files are merged with upstream changes
  if possible, and go into Conflict state if that fails.
- add 'resolved' command to be used after manual merging.


0.3:
- use the new file metadata, which provides checksum, size and mtime
- faster 'status', 'update', 'diff'
- improve argument handling, now e.g. 'osc up *' is possible
- on first usage, ask for username and password and store them in .oscrc
  (.netrc can still be used)
