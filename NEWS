0.4:
- allow 'up' inside a project directory (will automatically pull in all new
  packages). (For past checkouts, you may need to put the project name into 
  $prjdir/.osc/_project yourself).
- checkout: preserve mtimes
- add diff3 merge support. Locally modified files are merged with upstream changes
  if possible, and go into Conflict state if that fails.
- add 'resolved' command to be used after manual merging.


0.3:
- use the new file metadata, which provides checksum, size and mtime
- faster 'status', 'update', 'diff'
- improve argument handling, now e.g. 'osc up *' is possible
- on first usage, ask for username and password and store them in .oscrc
  (.netrc can still be used)
