since 0.6:

- add support for streaming the build log (thanks to Christoph Thiel)
- add 'rebuildpac' command
- add 'repourls' subcommand
- don't diff binary files
- don't try to merge binary files
- add a preliminary 'updatepacmetafromspec' subcommand, which takes package
  metadata from a specfile
- fix profiling wrapper
- set User-agent
- bugfixes: 
  - fix handling of filenames with '+' signs
  - make 'resolved' more robust
  - fix merge on 'update' if called from another directory
  - display reason for build status is 'broken'
  - handle HTTP error codes != 404 when reading metadata in edit_meta()
  - handle 'project not found' error in show_project_meta()


0.6:
- diff bugfix: sometimes displayed diff against obsolete files
- update bugfixes: fix update of working copy when adding a file from upstream
  which is missing locally; fix update in directory with unmodified files:
  don't try to merge if upstream file wasn't changed at all
- add: make it faster


0.5:
- help :-)
- add 'editmeta' subcommand: Edit project/package meta information, creating
  new project or package if it doesn't exist. The user interface is $EDITOR
- fix status letter for files merged on update (in analogy to svn , it is
  either G or U)
- if an old _files listing without any metadata is found, don't bother the user
  with it
- make all subcommands properly importable functions
- bug in 'resolved' command fixed, which wouldn't clear the conflict state of a file


0.4:
- allow 'up' inside a project directory (will automatically pull in all new
  packages). (For past checkouts, you may need to put the project name into 
  $prjdir/.osc/_project yourself).
- checkout: preserve mtimes
- add diff3 merge support. Locally modified files are merged with upstream changes
  if possible, and go into Conflict state if that fails.
- add 'resolved' command to be used after manual merging.


0.3:
- use the new file metadata, which provides checksum, size and mtime
- faster 'status', 'update', 'diff'
- improve argument handling, now e.g. 'osc up *' is possible
- on first usage, ask for username and password and store them in .oscrc
  (.netrc can still be used)
